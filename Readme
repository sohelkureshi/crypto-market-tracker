# Crypto Market Tracker

A simple web app to fetch and display live cryptocurrency market data using the CoinGecko API. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates both async/await and .then promise handling, and includes interactive search and sorting features.

## Features

- Fetches real-time cryptocurrency market data (name, symbol, price, % change, volume, market cap) from the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api).
- Displays data in a clean and responsive table.
- Search cryptocurrencies by name or symbol.
- Sort data by Market Capitalization or Percentage Change.
- Alerts the user if search is attempted without input or if sorting is already applied on the same criterion.
- Automatically resets search and sorting when search input is cleared.

## Usage

The key files:

- `index.html` — main layout and UI structure
- `styles.css` — styling for aesthetic and responsive design
- `script.js` — handles data fetching (async/await and .then methods), rendering, searching, sorting, and user interactions

### Fetching Data

Data is fetched from the CoinGecko API endpoint:

```
https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd&order=market_cap_desc&per_page=10&page=1&sparkline=false
```

The fetched JSON includes each coin's image, name, symbol, current price, 24h price change %, total volume, and market cap.

### Searching and Sorting

- Search input filters the table by coin name or symbol.
- Sort buttons reorder the table by market cap or % change.
- Attempts to re-sort by the current criterion show an alert.
- Clearing the search input resets the table to full data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sohelkureshi/crypto-market-tracker.git
